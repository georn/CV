## <a name="profile">Profile</a>

I am a junior full-stack developer with a passion for science and anything related to tech. I graduated from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a highly selective bootcamp in Europe and was a Computer Engineering student at Universidad Simón Bolívar in Venezuela. At Makers Academy, I built experience in Agile practices and a passion for reliable and maintainable code following the SOLID principles. During the bootcamp, I was able to build a [CLI Search Engine](https://github.com/georn/search_engine) within twelve weeks. I look forward to keep channelling my dedication to keep on learning and developing as a developer.

### Teamwork

*Volunteering at the Universidad Simón Bolívar Student Union for the First Aid Brigade during [2014 student protest](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http:%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fmundo%2Fnoticias%2F2014%2F02%2F140214_venezuela_protestas_estudiantes_az&edit-text=)* (2014)

* Collaborate, evaluate and organise with different teams of students the protest routes where the community of Simón Bolívar University participated. The communication between the various teams was a fundamental role in maintaining the security and physical integrity of hundreds of students to the different points of protest.

* At Makers Academy, we paired every day using Agile practices. During every project, we organised our stand-ups, gave each other feedback and discussed our struggles and successes.

### Keen Learner

* During my university years I had experience coding with C, Python and Java. I have an understanding of functional programming, and a foundation in analytic thinking gained while studying Sciences in Engineering courses. I am an independent learner; I like to find and read every resource possible to understand technologies and discover the best, efficient way to apply it to a problem at hand.

### Adaptility

* Aside from living and growing in Venezuela, I had the fortune to live in Canada, Spain and currently the UK. I  had experienced different cultures and societies. I am comfortable in a multicultural environment as Venezuela is a country forged by immigrants from Europe, many countries of the region, and natives.

* At Makers, we paired every day with somebody different. I was comfortable working with people from differents parts of the world to find solutions through working together to solve problems.
